# TensorFlow Tutorials

Hello! Welcome to this tutorial series on how to use Tensorflow for various tasks in your projects. The aim of this tutorial series is to teach you various concepts of Tensorflow along with segways into concepts that provide context on why are we trying to solve a data science problem. 

You'll notice a lot of comments in the notebooks, so please take your time in going through the notebook material and ask me questions if any on something that might seem ambiguous.

I have swapped out the traditional digit data with fashionMNIST data set in the below tutorials so as to update the tutorials with using new data set. 

## Introduction

* These tutorials are intended for beginners in Deep Learning and TensorFlow.
* Each tutorial covers a single topic.
* The source-code is well-documented.
* There is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Hr9sNUjfsmEu1ZniY0XpHSzl5uihcXZ) for each tutorial.
